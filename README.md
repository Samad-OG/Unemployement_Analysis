1. Regional Impact
I used Seaborn Bar Plots to identify states with the highest spikes in unemployment. The data clearly captures the volatility in the labour market during mid-2020.
2. Economic Indicators Heatmap
By analyzing the correlation between the Labour Participation Rate and Estimated Employed, I mapped out how the workforce shrunk during economic lockdowns.
3. Hierarchical Breakdown
The Plotly Sunburst Chart provides an interactive way to navigate through India's geographical unemployment distribution, making the data accessible for non-technical stakeholders.
